The issue stems from how `calc()` interacts with percentages within media queries. Percentages are relative to the parent container's size, and this size is evaluated differently within the media query context.  A reliable solution is to avoid percentages and use fixed units like pixels or rems for widths inside `calc()` in media queries. This ensures consistent results across different screen sizes.  Another approach is to adjust the calculation logic to avoid `calc()` entirely, achieving the same visual results using different CSS properties.
